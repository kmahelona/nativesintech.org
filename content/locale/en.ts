    p2: 'This year is exceptionally exciting because we will be hosting the NiTConf2022 in Gather Town (https://gather.town)! The team has spent many hours developing a unique space with cultural significance by integrating Native objects and significant places we use to "gather" to celebrate as a community. Our work is always guided by our traditional knowledge and ways, and the goal was to create a virtual space with a tech conference experience that reflects us, the Natives technologists. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do and we can’t wait to share this sacred space with you!',
